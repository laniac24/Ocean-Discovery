            </div>
            <h3 class="introduction">Sandy beaches are loose deposits of sand, including possibly some gravel or shells, that cover the shoreline in many places. They make up a large portion (about 30%) of the world's ice-free coastlines. Beaches serve as buffer zones or shock absorbers that protect the coastline, sea cliffs or dunes from direct wave attack. It is an extremely dynamic environment where sand, water and air flow permanently interact. Beaches are also important coastal recreational areas and tourist destinations. Fine-grained sand beaches tend to be gently sloping and quite flat.<br>The intertidal beach zone is covered part of the day by water and part of the day it is exposed to air. Tides, waves and swash supply nutrients and food. When the tide retreats, waste products, eggs and larvae are taken away by the backwash. Organisms living on sandy shores have adapted to this dynamic environment.<br>Several groups of vertebrates make use of sandy beaches for foraging, nesting and breeding. Turtles nest on the backshore of sandy beaches. Birds use the beach for foraging, nesting and roosting. Seals use several areas of the beach for nesting, molting, breeding and raising pups. Other terrestrial animals such as otters, baboons, raccoons, lions,… may descend onto the beach to forage.</h3>

                    <h3>Sand Colors</h3>
                    <p>Beach sand varies in composition based on local geology and minerals. <strong>White sand</strong> is mainly quartz and limestone, while <strong>light-colored sand</strong> contains quartz and iron. <strong>Tropical white sand</strong> forms from calcium carbonate in coral and shell fragments, as does <strong>pink coral sand</strong>, which gets its hue from coral. Black sand, made of basalt and obsidian, is volcanic. <strong>Red and orange sands</strong> result from oxidized or iron-rich rocks. <strong>Green sand</strong> contains olivine and is notable for potential carbon sequestration. Beaches like Papakolea in Hawaii, Bermuda, and Santorini illustrate these colorful sands shaped by nature's diverse geological processes.</p>

                    <h3>Wildlife</h3>
                    <p>A beach is a dynamic and unstable environment, constantly shaped by wind, waves, and tides. These ever-changing conditions expose plants and animals to potentially harsh elements, requiring special adaptations for survival. Many beach-dwelling animals have evolved to burrow into the sand for protection and food. These organisms feed on organic material brought in by the waves. In turn, crabs, insects, and shorebirds prey on these small invertebrates, forming an interconnected food web. <br>Some species depend heavily on beach habitats for reproduction. For example, sea turtles come ashore to dig nests and lay their eggs in the sand, relying on quiet, undisturbed ocean beaches for successful hatching. Similarly, the endangered piping plover and several tern species nest directly on the sand, making them vulnerable to disturbances and habitat loss. Protection of their nesting grounds is essential for their survival. <br>Vegetation also plays a critical role on beaches. In areas less affected by direct wave action, plants like seagrasses, sea oats, and other dune flora help stabilize the sand, prevent erosion, and provide food and shelter for wildlife. These plants are specially adapted to tolerate salt spray, intense sun, and nutrient-poor conditions. <br>Ocean beaches are unique habitats that support organisms specifically adapted to survive in environments shaped by tidal overwash, shifting sands, and saline exposure. In the southeastern United States, examples of specialized beach flora include sea oats, sea rocket, beach elder, beach morning glory (Ipomoea pes-caprae), and beach peanut. Faunal examples include mole crabs (Hippoidea), coquina clams (Donax), ghost crabs, and the white beach tiger beetle. Many of these species are found nowhere else, making beach ecosystems not only ecologically rich but also important for biodiversity conservation. Preserving these habitats ensures the survival of these highly adapted and often vulnerable species.</p>

            </div>
            <h3 class="introduction">Kelp forests are underwater areas with a high density of kelp, which covers a large part of the world's coastlines. Smaller areas of anchored kelp are called kelp beds. They are recognized as one of the most productive and dynamic ecosystems on Earth. Although algal kelp forest combined with coral reefs only cover 0.1% of Earth's total surface, they account for 0.9% of global primary productivity. Kelp forests occur worldwide throughout temperate and polar coastal oceans. In 2007, kelp forests were also discovered in tropical waters near Ecuador.
<br>Physically formed by brown macroalgae, kelp forests provide a unique habitat for marine organisms and are a source for understanding many ecological processes. Over the last century, they have been the focus of extensive research, particularly in trophic ecology, and continue to provoke important ideas that are relevant beyond this unique ecosystem. For example, kelp forests can influence coastal oceanographic patterns and provide many ecosystem services.</h3>

                    <h3>Carbon sequester</h3>
                    <p>Kelp forests grow in rocky places along the shore that are constantly eroding carrying material out to the deep sea. The kelp then sinks to the ocean floor and store the carbon where is it unlikely to be disturbed by human activity. Researchers from the University of Western Australia estimated kelp forest around Australia sequestered 1.3-2.8 teragrams of carbon per year which is 27–34% of the total annual blue carbon sequestered in the Australian continent by tidal marshes, mangrove forests and seagrass beds. Every year 200 million tons of carbon dioxide are being sequestered by macroalgae such as kelp.</p>

                    <h3>Enemy and Ally</h3>
                    <p>Kelp forest ecology is shaped by both top-down and bottom-up processes. Top-down control involves predators regulating herbivores, while bottom-up control depends on abiotic factors like light and nutrient availability that support kelp growth. Kelp often thrives in nutrient-rich upwelling zones, where it forms the base of a food web that supports herbivores and their predators.
<br>In Alaskan kelp forests, sea otters are a classic example of top-down control. They prey on sea urchins, keeping their populations in check. Without sea otters, urchins overgraze the kelp, leading to ecosystem collapse and loss of biodiversity. Here, sea otters are considered a keystone species.
In Southern California, kelp forests lack sea otters but remain stable thanks to other predators like lobsters and California sheephead. This predator redundancy means that if one species is removed, others can still regulate urchins. However, removing multiple predators can lead to urchin overpopulation and kelp decline.
<br>Similar patterns occur in Nova Scotia, South Africa, Australia, and Chile. These cases highlight how both top-down and bottom-up forces influence kelp ecosystems, with their relative importance varying by region. Ongoing research aims to better understand these dynamics to guide conservation and management efforts.</p>
